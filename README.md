# html-latex-converter
A simple python script that can convert HTML into LaTeX code. Supports configuration with custom commands, different commands for bold and italic text, etc.
Supports regex for search and replacement.

## Usage
Create a file called `test.html` in the same directory as the script (this step is customisable). Customise the conversion process to the need. Run `python3 converter.py` and the output will be saved to the file `output.txt` in the same directory.
